## Key Distribution

Use common security key.

Main purpose of key distribution to ensure that keys are private between the sender and receiver.

Need frequency changing the keys. -> limits the ability of ...



**Key distribution alternatives**

1. physically deliver
2. third part **select or deliver key**.
3. using previous key to encrypt a new key
4. third party C to **relay key** if the communications channels with C are secured


<br />


### Key Hierarchy

**Session key**

A temporary key

For one logical session only



**Master key**

For encrypt session key

Shared by user and key distribution centre.



`However, the scale of the problem is vastly reduced, as only N master keys are required, one for each entity. Thus, master keys can be distributed in some non-cryptographic way, such as physical delivery. `



### Key Distribution Scenario

Assumption: 

1. A wants to communicates with B.
2. Each user have master key agreed with KDC.

**Issues**

* If two entities in different domains desire a shared key, then the corresponding local KDCâ€™s can communicate through a global KDC
* The hierarchical concept can be extended to three or more layers
* Scheme minimizes the effort involved in master key distribution because most master keys are those shared by a local KDC with its local entities



### Hybrid Key Distribution

* retain use of private-key KDC
* shares secret master key with each user
* distributes session key using master key
* public-key used to distribute master keys
  * especially useful with widely distributed users
* rationale
  * performance
  * backward compatibility


<br />

### Session Key Lifetime

* More frequency more secure
* The distribution of session can delay the start of exchange
* Connection-oriented: using a new session key for each new session; depends on the length of time.
* Transition-oriented: the most secure is using new session key for each exchange. However, in our case, we use a given session key for a certain fixed period only or for a certain number of transactions

<br />


### Random Numbers

statistically random, uniform distribution, independent

unpredictability of future values from previous values

<br />

**Pseudorandom Number Generators (PRNGs)**

not truly random

can pass random test

<br />

**Linear Congruential Generator**

Xn+1= (aXn+ c) mod m

Widely use

C: Random()

<br />

**Using Block Ciphers as PRNGs**

<br />

**Blum Blum Shub Generator**

xi= (x(i-1)) ^ 2mod n
where n=p.q, and primes p,q=3 mod 4

Unpredictable

difficulty of factoring n

slow

<br />

**Natural Random Noise**

True random

Find a regular but random event and monitor:

operate by measuring unpredictable natural processes, such as pulse detectors of ionizing radiation events, gas discharge tubes, and leaky capacitors.

Problems for bias or uneven distribution and use
