  <br>

## What is Cyber Security?
* Management of attacks and risks that support modern businesses....

<br>

***
Symmetric and asymmetric 
Symmetric: since antiquity
Asymmetric: public key

## One way functions
* Given x in domain it is easy to compute f(x)
* Given y in range, it is difficult to find x in domain such that f(x)=y
  <br> 

## Diffie-Hellman Idea:
* K = (YB)^XA mod q = (a^XB mod q)^XA mod q = (a^XB)^XA mod q 






### Three important concerns of Information security

1. Confidentiality 机密性 -> Preserving authorized restriction on information access and disclosure(揭露), including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary.
2. Integrity -> against information modified
3. Availability -> Ensure timely and reliable access to and use of information
4. Authentication
5. Accountability 责任性
