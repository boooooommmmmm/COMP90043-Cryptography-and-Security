# Week 5



## RSA Signatures

* Signature is a pattern that depends on the message being singend
* Must use some information unique to the sender to prevent both forgery and denial
* Relatively easy to produce the digital signature
* Relatively easy to recognize and verify the digital signature
* Computationally infeasible to forge a digital signature



### RSA Signatures properties 

* RSA signature is a public key signature scheme
* Signature is a means for a trusted third party to bind the identity of a user to a public key
* Complement of RSA public encryption
* Private key signs messages; public key verify the signatures



### Forgery attack
