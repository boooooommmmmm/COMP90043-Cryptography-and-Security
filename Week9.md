## ElGamal Signature

The signature should have non-repudiation property (the signer cannot deny creating the signature).



S1,S2

Verify



### Schnorr Signature

???



###Digital Signature Standard (DSS)

<br />



### Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)

Smaller and faster than RSA

depends on difficulty of computing discrete logarithms

ElGamal& Schnorrschemes

Maximum size of the cyclic group = p-1.

# User Authentication

user authentication is the fundamental building block and the primary line of defense. 

User authentication is the basis for most types of access control and for user accountability

Identificaiton -> specify identifier

Verification -> bind entity and identifier

<br />

## Mutual Authentication

Protocols enables mutuallly change identifty and session key

**Two issues:** 

1. confidentiality
2. Timeliness
